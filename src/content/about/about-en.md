# Hi, I'm Thiago Colman 👋

I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer passionate about building scalable, well-structured, and elegant digital products.

Over the years, I've worked on web platforms, SaaS products, and business systems — always focusing on clean architecture, performance, and long-term maintainability. I enjoy transforming complex business problems into simple, efficient, and reliable solutions.

## 🚀 What I Do

- Design and build full stack applications
- Develop scalable backend systems
- Create modern, responsive front-end interfaces
- Improve legacy systems with better architecture
- Collaborate with international remote teams

My technical stack often includes:

- **Ruby on Rails**
- **React / JavaScript / TypeScript**
- REST APIs & integrations
- SQL & relational databases
- Cloud-based deployments

## 🧠 How I Think

I value:

- Clean and readable code
- Clear communication
- Business-driven engineering decisions
- Continuous improvement
- Ownership and responsibility

I believe great software is not just about writing code — it's about understanding the business context, the users, and the long-term impact of every technical decision.

## 🌎 Beyond Code

I'm based in Brazil and collaborate with global teams.  
I’m deeply interested in technology, product strategy, typography, and thoughtful digital experiences.

This blog is where I share insights about software engineering, architecture, productivity, and lessons learned throughout my journey.
